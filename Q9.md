## Q9

Both type coercion and type conversion act to change the data type of a given object. The main difference between the two is the nature of the catalyst that initiates the conversion: type coercion is usually implicit, whereas type conversion is always explicit. 1.  
Python utilizes both type coercion and type conversion. Some examples of type conversion in Python can be found in the ```int()```, ```float()``` and ```str()``` functions. When invoked these functions will convert a given argument to a specified data type (integer, float or string, respectively). This conversion happens only when the function is invoked and passed an argument, making it an explicit action. One use case of type conversion can be found in accepting a number input from an input prompt. The ```input()``` function automatically casts any input as a string. To use this input in a mathematical expression it must be converted to a numerical type:  

```
#input is automatically cast as a string:
userInput = input('Type a number ')
# Converts input to an integer (type conversion). Stores result in new variable:
userInputInteger = int(userInput)
# Now math can happen:
incrementInput = userInputInteger + 1
```                    
An example of of type coercion in Python can be found in an f-string: Python will accept a string with interspersed expressions contained within curly braces. These expressions will be evaluated, coerced into a string and finally interpolated into the resulting string - an implicit change of data type. 

```
#Declare a variable with an integer value
luftballons = 99
#F string will implicitly convert our variable to a string without us having to invoke str() function: 
nenaSings = f"{luftballons} red ballons, floating in the summer sky"
```
