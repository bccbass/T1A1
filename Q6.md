## Q6

>Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

### Python

Python is an open source, high level programming language develovped by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is approachable for beginners to learn thanks to a straightforward syntax, dynamic typing and extremely robust build in library.(1) The Python community is extremely active resulting in a great deal of resources for new developers learning the language. There are also a great many external modules and packages that can be imported to extend Pythons functionality. Python is used in a wide array of applications; data analysis, scientific and web applications and perhaps most notably machine learning and artificial intelligence. Thanks to a straightforward and dynamically typed syntax and lack of a compiling process creating programs can be swift and is well suited to Rapid Aplication Development. (2)  
Some drawbacks of Python could be seen as a ractive result of its strenghts. Ths can most notably experienced in speed and memory usage. Becasue Python is interpreted and dynamically typed its runtime compiler has to validate every variable when running a program. Python is also not optimized for conservative memory usage, with a garbage collection process that is not as efficient as other languages. (2) Python has also not been tailored towards web and mobile applications, is not tailored to database instnsive applications and does not support multi-threaded processing.

### C

The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970's. C is a middle level language as it operates as both a high level programming language as well as more directly with low level instructions closer to machine instruction.(3) This makes C useful for writing programs that interface closely to a machines particular CPU architecture such as operating systems and drivers. (3) Some programs and operating systems written in C include Windows, Oracle Database, Git and the Python Interpreter. (4) C is a compiled language, with many cross platform compilers avaible, meaning a broadly written C progeram is capable of running on many different machine architectures.  (4)  
Some of the drawbacks or challenges of C can be found in the area of memory management: memory allocation and garbage collecting must be handled manually which can result in memory leaks and other unwanted outcomes. The C compiler uses very few checks, placing the onus of avoiding errors or unexpected processes on the programmer. C also lacks Object and Class data structures making object oriented programming impossible. (6)
