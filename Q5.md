## Q5

> Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

All programming languages are written in high-level language that humans are capable of reading and understanding, however computers operate only using low level binary languages such as machine code or assembly language. An intermediary process is needed to convert the high level programming language into a low level machine language. (1) This is where interpreters and compilers enter the picture. They are programs written in a high-level language that parse and re-write the code to be executable by machines. Compilers and intepreters can be written in the same or different language as their target files (eg. a Java file being compiled by a program written in Java OR in C) ( 2.)

A **compiler** is a program that takes a target file as an input then checks for lexical, semantic and syntactical accuracy, parses and optimizes the instructions within to output a completed file written in a low level machine language. This output is specific to a targeted computing architecture such as iOS or Intel Pentium architecture and is not universally readable between different machine architectures. (1)
An **interpreter** is a program that interprets a target file line by line, every time the program is executed. This allows source code to be more universally usable between different machine architectures, but the disadvantage of being significantly slower than a compiler. One of the most common interpreted languages is JavaScript - the programming language of the web. (3)
