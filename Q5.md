> Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

  

All programming languages are written in high-level language that humans are capable of reading and understanding, however computers operate only using low level binary languages such as machine instruction or assembly language. An intermediary process is needed to convert the high level programming language into a low level machine language. (1) This is where interpreters and compilers enter the picture. They are programs written in a high-level language that parse and re-write the code to be executable by machines. Compilers and interpreters can be written in the same or different language as their target files (eg. a Java file being compiled by a program written in Java OR in C) ( 2.)

  

A **compiler** is a program that takes a target file as an input then checks for lexical, semantic and syntactical accuracy, parses and optimizes the instructions within to output a completed file written in a low level machine language. This output is specific to a targeted computing architecture such as iOS or Intel Pentium architecture and is not universally readable between different machine architectures. (1) One example of a compiled language is C. Developed in the early 1970's with an aim to build operating systems and other applications that interact closely with a machines processing architecture, C programs must be compiled by a separate compiler in order to run.  There are a great many compilers available that will compile C programs for many different system architectures. Because C is compiled before run time it can yield extremely fast and efficient programs.

  

An **interpreter** is a program that takes a target file as input and interprets the code line by line, every time the program is executed. This allows source code to be more universally usable between different machine architectures, but has the disadvantage of being significantly slower than a compiler. One of the most common interpreted languages is JavaScript - the programming language of the web. (3) Javascript (among others) utilizes Just In Time compilation, meaning it is not compiled before being deployed but is interpreted at run-time. In the context of the client-server model it has the benefit of freeing up server side resources and allowing the user to download the script as part of an HTTP request for the browser to then interpret and execute the script, ultimately creating a much faster and more seamless web experience.
