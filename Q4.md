# Q4

> Identify THREE data structures used in the Python programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

### **List**
A list is a comma delimited collection of objects contained within square brackets: ```my_list = [1, 2, 3]```.(1) Its contents can be any data type and can be heterogeneous; multiple data types can be contained within the same list. ```my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'A', 3.14] ```. A list can even contain other lists or dictionaries: ```my_nested_list = [[1,2,3], [5,6,7]]```
It is indexed, has length and has a host of built-in methods accessible to alter or manipulate its contents. Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified, reassigned and sorted. Additionally lists can have elements removed, inserted, concatenated and appended. They are also iterable, which means they can easily be used in loops:
```Python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
for el in my_list:
    print(el)
```
Since a variable can only store one value at a time, a list is well suited to store collections of related(or unrelated) objects which can be accessed from the same variable. They can then be manipulated and acted upon relationally as a single data structure. One common use  case is utilizing a list to contain a collection of dictionaries:
```Python
People = [
{‘person1’: ‘Bobby’},
{‘person2’: ‘Jimmy’},
{‘person3’: ‘Jamey’}
]
```
This collection of people can now be iterated over and acted upon as a single data structure containing a group of related elements. 




### **Tuple**
A tuple is a comma delimited collection of elements contained within parentheses: 
```
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C')
```
It is extremely similar to a list with the main difference being that it is immutable; it cannot be altered, manipulated or have elements reordered, added or removed.(1) It is also indexed, has length and is iterable. 
Tuples are used when a list data structure is required but its contents are not intended to be altered. If a developer needs to manipulate a tuple there are built-in functions that help to facilitate this. The tuple() and list() functions serve to convert the passed in argument to their respective data types: 
```Python
print(list((1, 2, 3)))
``` 
would yield:
```
>>> [1, 2, 3]
```
To leave a list or tuple intact before manipulating its contents the ```copy()``` function can be called to duplicate it. This creates a completely new data instance with a unique reference ID from the original, which can then be converted to a list and mutated in any number of ways. (1)
A tuple is not only implemented to shield contents from alteration but also to signal to other developers the intent and spirit of its intent that the data should remain undisturbed: 
```Python
the_beatles = (‘John’, ‘Paul’, ‘George’, ‘Ringo’)
```


### **Dictionary**
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key/value pairs that are comma delimited and contained within curly braces:
```Python
person = {
'name': 'John',
'height': 190,
'age': 54
}
```
Dictionaries are unordered which means they cannot be accessed by index values, however they are iterable and later versions of Python will store the order in which their key/value pairs were originally formatted.(2) Dictionaries are particularly useful when modeling data structures on real life objects and people as seen in the previous example. Their paired values can be represented by any data types or structures available in the Python language. This gives dictionaries great flexibility and detail when modeling both abstract data and real life people, places and things.
