# Q4

> Identify THREE data structures used in the Python programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

**Numeric types** encompasse three subtypes: **int, float** and **complex**. 1. 

- An int represents an integer (whole number without fractional component, either positive or negative).  ```eg. 1, 8, -16, -256```
- A float represents any number, positive or negative, that has a fractional component. 
```eg. 1.2, 2.4, 3.14159, -10000.00001```
- Complex numbers represent imaginary numbers comprised of a number and an imaginary part denoted with a j. 2.  

While these three numerical data types are distinct, Python allows for mixed arithmetic between types and will automatically adjust types to match width of the widest type within an expression.  

eg. ```1 + 1.5 = 2.5```  will be internally adjusted to ```1.0 + 1.5 = 2.5```.  

Why not just have one numerical data type? It comes down to memory allocation and computational speed. Though you could have just one universal numerical type storing unneeded fractional or imaginary information is costly both to memory and processing.  

Numeric types are used strictly to represent values and for implemenation in mathemetical contexts. For a numerical symbol to be used in a string statement it must be converted to a string type first. 3. 


**Strings** are an indexed collection of unicode characters contained within either single ``` ` ``` or double ``` " ``` quotation marks. Strings are typically used to represent words, sentences and phrases. They are zero-indexed, have length and their contents can be accessed using bracket notation like any array, because they are indeed arrays!: 
``` 
myString = "Hello, world!"
firstLetter = myString[0] 
print(firstLetter) # prints 'H'
 ```
 Strings are essential to programming language as they introduce meaning and human readability to code. They allow us to store, manipulate and make use of the most familiar and universal type of human communication and expression.  

A **Bool** is short for boolean, named for English mathemetician George Boole. 4.  
A boolean is used to represent two states: True or False. Bools are essential in Python as they are the basis of control flow structures and conditional logic. They are particularly useful in computer science as their strict duality reflects a computers Binary language: 0 or 1, True or False.  5.
An example of a boolean used in a control flow structures can be seen in the following simple example: 
``` 
#Set isRaining variable to True
isRaining = True
#Checks if it is raining outside to make an actionable decision:
if isRaining:
# If it is raining prints to stay inside
    print("Stay inside or you will get wet")
#Otherwise it prints its safe to go outside and play.
else: print("Go out and play!)  
```
