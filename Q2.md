 >- packets 
 >- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) 
 >- routers and routing 
 >- domains and DNS

> Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet


Packet technology enables internet users to send vast amounts of data globally with limited interruptions and congestion. When sending large messages and files over networks congestion can occur as a result of routes being unavailable while the transer is taking place. This manifests either in subesquent data having to wait for its completion, or take significantly circuitous routes to reach its destination. This problem was ameliorated by implementing the use of data packets and packet switching. This technology breaks up large messages and files into smaller, more manageable packets, allowing them to travel more efficiently over multiple routes to end up at the same destination. To then reconstitute these packets the transfer relies on a UDP or user data protocol, which is included in the header of the transfer and requests a port to transfer the packets data to on arrival. UDP does not return a confirmation of receipt to the sender. This has the benefit of not taking up extra network bandwidth but the short coming of not notifying the sender as to whether it's transfer was received successfully. When it is imperative that a package is received in whole TCP, or transfer control protocol is implemented instead. The main difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP sends an acknowledgment of receipt to its origin destination. Applications such as email and direct messaging implement TCP as it's imperative that the entire uncorrupted message is received and reconstituted, whereas scenarios in which speed trumps precision such as voice over internet programs (VoIP) and multiplayer games UDP is implemented as acknowledgement of receipt is less important than speed. In both scenarios scenarios the transfer is then validated with a checksum; the sum of all the data packets transferred, which is included in the transfer header, and then subsequently checked against the sum of the received packets. 

IP addresses were introduced in 1983 by the US Military's ARPANET as part of the tcp/ip protocol. They ensure every computer that is to be connected to a network is assigned a unique identifier. IP addresses facilitate tcp/ip packet transfers, ensuring disparate packets that have travelled over multiple routes end up at the intended destination where they are reassembled to their original state. IPv4 (or Internet Protocol Version 4) is the current version in use, but is reaching a point of inflection as the available pool of addresses is near exhausted. This is the result of the ubiquity of internet connected devices, not limited to computers, smart phones and tables but the vast amounts of Internet of Things devics as well. The anticipated solution is the implementation of IPv6 which uses a 128bit address,  as opposed to IPv4's 32bit address structure. This creates a pool of 340 billion billion billion addresses, versus IPv4's comparatively paltry 4.3 billion addresses. However, the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is complicated and requires many challenges to be met before it can successfully be implemented. $^2$

 Website addresses are comprised of an IP address followed by a port number. 1984 saw an effort to make these addresses more human readable via the implementation of domains and the domain name system. Domains are what we recognize as modern Internet addresses such as facebook.com, whitehouse.gov and unitednations.org.  The DNS is a directory of servers in which all of the domain names are stored with their corresponding IP addresses. It is like the yellowpages of the Internet. $^3$ Everytime a domain is requested to be served the browser makes a request to the DNS to direct the user to the associated stored ip address. This allows users to type a familar name into a browser versus having to remember a 32bit IP address and port number.

1974 was a breakthrough year. A proposal was published to link Arpa-like networks together into a so-called “inter-network”, which would have no central control and would work around a transmission control protocol (which eventually became TCP/IP).


 1983: Arpanet computers switch over to TCP/IP

January 1, 1983 was the deadline for Arpanet computers to switch over to the TCP/IP protocols developed by Vinton Cerf. A few hundred computers were affected by the switch. The name server was also developed in ’83.

The domain name system was created in 1984 along with the first Domain Name Servers (DNS).

The domain name system was important in that it made addresses on the Internet more human-friendly compared to its numerical IP address counterparts. DNS servers allowed Internet users to type in an easy-to-remember domain name and then converted it to the IP address automatically
