## Q11

>Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?” 
> - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem 
> - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified

*While I find the premise of a potential labor dispute being solved with automation and technology morally questionable and in direct conflict with the spirit of Question 7, I will assume the entire staff has won the lottery on a group ticket and no longer needs to work.

Creating an app to replace the entire staff of a restaurant would be tricky indeed. It would require functionality to cover front of house concerns; greeting and seating diners, take and process orders, check on diners throughout meal (refill? more BBQ Sauce?) and running food from the kitchen to the diner when ready. Back of house concerns would require a huge amount of physical infrastructure to replace line cooks, chefs and food runners, not to mention handling and preparing ingredients. There is also the issue of sequencing incoming orders to make sure they are prepared and delivered as a set and in a timely fashion. There are the monetary concerns of accepting and processing payment; digital, bank cards and cash (cashless restaurants pose a problem as they exclude customers who are unbanked or too young have credit or debit cards)$^1$. There is also the issue of keeping track of stock of food ingredients and reusables (napkins, cutlery etc.) and keeping track of their inventory and expiry dates so they can be reordered before running out. Some classes I might employ to address these concerns when building the restaurant app:

### Menu Item: 
This class encompasses the menu items offered to customers. It is the most forward facing class as it is the main attraction of any restaurant. It might include price, time offered(breakfast, lunch, dinner), is_featured_special, seasonal, alergen_information. This class must not only provide pertinent information about menu items but also contain some amount of enticement to attract customers to the menu item to inspire purchase. 
```Python 
menu_item = {
'name': String,
'price': float,
'is_featured_special': Boolean,
'seasonal': Boolean,
'description': String,
'ingredients': [String]
'allergen_information': [String],
'time_available': (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
}
```


### Ingredient Item:
This is the class for inventory of recipe ingredients: the bulk stores of produce, bread, meat etc. This class includes name, quantity, order delivery estimate, expiration dates, distributors, last ordered and perhaps most importantly quantity on hand. There might be methods to alert when stock is running low so restock can be ordered in time. Or methods to alert when a large number quantity of an item is approaching expiry date to create a special so it is used before it can no longer be served. I would use this class as it is imperative to know what ingredients are on hand and keep necessary stock so menu items are always available. 
```Python 
ingredient_item = { 
'name': ,
'cost': ,
'quantity': ,
'useby_expiration': ,
'distributors':,
'last ordered':,
'last_ordered_amount':,
method: reorder alert when low stock
method: create special item large quantity and sellby date is approaching
}
```

### Reusable Item:
This would be a class to cover all reusable items such as napkins, cutlery, takeout boxes and menus. Similar to the ingredient class it is important to keep track of reusable items so they do not run out and customers can dine/take out orders without interruption or inconvenience. 
```Python
single_use_supply = {
'quantity': ,
'distributor': ,
'cost': float,
'order_time': datetime,
environmental_green_score: int,
method: low qty alert, reorder
}
```

### customer_order:
This class covers each instance of an order (covering a range of 1 or more individuals in a given party). It is essential to associate a customer, their payment information and their order details can be paid, prepared and served accordingly. This class might have and order number, time ordered, items ordered ( which would need an associated list of dictionaries to cover items would need to be associated with different party members and special requests and allergy information), total order sum. Some methods included in this class might be order tracking, serve time estimate or bill splitting. This class is the main the main conduit between customer and restaurant and is integral to a functional restaurant apps success - customers have to be able to order and pay for items, and the process of preparation and delivery must be robust or there is literally no business model. 
```Python
'customer_order' = {
'ordered_items': List,
'time_placed': DateTime,
'seating_position_sub_order': Dictionary,
'order_number': int,
'order_total': float,
'special_requests': Dictionary,

Methods: track_order_method()
when_available() method
order_confirmation() method
}
```

### Customer:
A customer class would act to store personal and contact information of customers. It would facilitate functionality to log order/visit frequency, repeat ordered items and guide targeted advertisement. It could store payment information and help create a more personalized experience for the customer. 
```Python

customer= {
information: {name, address, email},
saved_payment_method: payement_method,
visit_log: frequency,
frequently-ordered_items: List
}
```
### Customer Review:
This class would cover reviews of the restaurant to help with internal quality control as well as keeping the establishment competitive and profitable. It could also be useful in regard to advertising material. Classes could include food quality, customer experience, ambience etc all with an integer range. A fuller more verbose review section would also be a wise addition to the class. 
```Python
customer_review = {
'dining_experience': Range
'star_rating': Range,
'food_quality': Range,
'service_quality': Range,
'would_recommend': boolean,
'review': string
}
```
