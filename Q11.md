## Q11

>Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?” 
> - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem 
> - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified

*While I find the premise of a potential labor dispute being solved with automation and technology morally questionable and in direct conflict with the spirit of Question 7, I will assume the entire staff has won the lottery on a group ticket and no longer need to work.

Front of house concerns
Create an interactive interface to take customers orders and  process order information to be prepared. Functionality to parse incoming orders and deduce preperation sequence so meals are completed as quickly as possible and served in proper sequece. Functionality to check back throughout meal to add items or take requests  (refills, more bbq sauce, lemon wedges etc). 

Back of house concerns:
There would have to be extensive physical infrastructure implemented to seamlessly replace chefs, sous chefs and line cooks in preparing meals and delivering food to tables or in to-go boxes to front of house. The app would have to account for order flow, food preperation sequences and required prep time, ingredient amounts, ingnredient order (add eggs, whisk. Then add sugar, whisk, then milk and dry ingredients) as well as methods for preperation (whisking, roasting, searing, chopping, dicing (julienne? rustic?))

Monetary concerns:
The app would require functionality to cover: 
Combine and calculate order totals. Secure and seamless processing of customers payments(credit, debt, gift cards) with payment confirmation for both restaurant and customer. Provide itemized receipt. Create a system for taking cash (cashless restaurants are problematic as they exclude customers who are unbanked or too young have credit or debit cards).(1) 
Functionality to calculate the meta transactional information - daily, weekly, monthly sales totals. Calculate total income, expense and profits. 

Food and other supply and reording:
Functionality to process  the rate ingredients are being used versus available quantities left in order to place order to distrubuters to restock ingredients. This functionality should also account for use by dates and produce freshness.
