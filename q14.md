*Definition of Prime number: Any positive integer that is divisible by exactly two numbers only* 1.

- Start with a divisor set to 1.
- Check to see if input number has *at least* two unique factors:   
    - i/divisor & i/i should yield two unique numbers.
    (this covers the edge case of 1).
        - If not two unique numbers input is not prime, move to next input number.
        - If so proceed to next step.
- Increase divisor by one and check if it divides evenly into the input number.
    - If NO: repeat the previous step (checking if input is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.)
    - If YES:
        - *divisor < input number*?: we have found a third factor which means number is not prime, move to next input number. 
        -  *divisor = input number*?: we have proceeded through all numbers without finding any additional factors. This number has exactly two factors so we can add input number to list of Prime Numbers.
- Repeat this process for each number up to 100.
