### _Twitter, Free Speech and the Media_
Twitters selective censoring of certain media outlets and stories is an interesting case study: the same company has been run by both left-coded Jack Dorsey and right-coded Elon Musk. Yet Twitter has removed stories and limited reach of media outlets from opposing political sides under both leaders. This is evidenced in Twitter-under-Dorsey working closely with US government administration to ban targeted media topics that were later found to have credence and under Musks leadership as seen in the labeling of NPR as government affiliated media and the moderation and censoring of a Canadian documentary critical of unchecked corporate power (The New Corporation, 2021). In America the First Amendment is held sacrosanct and is rooted in a principled free speech absolutism, however the law is very clear that Twitter, under both leaders as a private company, in no way ran afoul of it and can moderate its platform as it sees fit. But how does the IT professional square these policies with respect to to their own personal ethical code? The removal of harmful or targeted disinformation seems like a good idea (this would have been a godsend with regard to Facebooks role in the Rohingya Muslim genocide in Myanmar), but this question of free speech absolutism is more likely a personal value-set as the law provides no legal recourse. As a single employee of a behemoth corporation bound to iron-clad NDA's I would posit that the only recourse and responsibility a developer at Twitter might have in the scenario of free speech, freedom of thought and the media, is to ensure their work and their employers values are in harmony with their own, and if not, start applying for roles that align more closely with them. As Civil Rights law firm Chandra Law states when asked if one can sue social media sites over first amendment issues: “The answer is always ‘no.’ Not if you expect to get anything out of it, anyway…. Please do not contact us about this.” $^1$

### _NSO Pegasus Spyware_

>"The most serious implications of something like Pegasus is that it makes it much more unlikely that a dictatorial regime will become a democracy... [T]hose were already regimes and systems that were obsessive about trying to monitor their populations so that they could control them and prevent them from rising up and overthrowing them. And this technology exponentially increases your capacity to do that."
> -David Pegg

Israeli tech company NSO's spyware technology Pegasus is marketed as a tool for governments and nation states to fight gun violence, crime and terrorism, however its de facto application seems to be far less noble. When successfully embedded on a targets mobile phone Pegasus has root administrator access to the entire device including GPS, voice, photo and data. The Forbidden Stories media collective uncovered widespread governmental abuse of the software in a widely publicized report released in 2021. While it is ostensibly for anti-crime and anti-terror applications the report uncovered Pegasus Software engaged by 45 nations, many of which with dubious human rights and political histories, targeting a minimum of 1400 journalists, aid workers and government officials. One of the most shocking instances was its role in the assassination of dissident journalist Jamaal Khashoggi, a Washington Post reporter critical of the Saudi government. Pegasus was placed on the phones of members of his inner circle by Saudi security officials months before he was assassinated and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. While NSO universally denies any wrong doing WhatsApp parent company Meta and Apple filed lawsuits, with the Meta suit recently receiving US Supreme Court approval to proceed. The Biden administration has blacklisted NSO and included it in an "entities list" of organizations that are “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Although Pegasus is a tool implemented by the highest structures of power it is important to remember that it was developed and created by IT professionals, begging the question as to what their ethical responsibility is in contributing to irrefutably harmful technologies. It seems that while there may have been no Israeli laws broken, because the tech is deployed globally it falls under a broader swath of regulation, and quite clearly has run amok legally as evidenced by lawsuits and US response. In my opinion an IT professional should feel obliged to uphold a rigorous set of personal and professional ethics, taking action when their professional responsibilities cross clear cut legal and ethical boundaries. In the case of Pegasus there is obvious legal precedent for a developer to raise an alarm and alert management, media or outside entities of the abuses taking place. Sadly, I cannot imagine a scenario where a developer at Pegasus would be able to singlehandedly alter the policies of NSO via proscribed channels or outside whistleblowing without creating irreversible life-changing repercussions for themselves and their families.  Although it is comforting to think that as individuals we have the power to affect direct change in a meaningful way and will be lauded positively and proportionally for the moral courage exhibited I am reminded of the case of American whistleblower Edward Snowden; an IT professional who reported an illegal and unconstitutional abuse in the professional role he was occupying. After exhausting legal internal channels to raise concern and alert management of ethical breaches he resorted to blowing the whistle and turning to the media. And even with US whistleblower laws in supposedly in place history shows what rewards were bestowed on him for his ethical rigor. Althohugh unlike the Twitter example there are clearly international laws violated with NSO's Pegasus software I fear the developers options for remediation are quite similar to that of the Twitter developers armed only with ethical umbrage: resign from your role creating unethical technology and find one that aligns with your values. As mere individuals this is the extent of our power in relation to the super structures of State and Mega Corporations. In researching these topics and thinking about a developers ethical responsibility and recourse one line from from Haile Selassie I's 1963 address to the United Nations kept replaying in my mind: "[W]e must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls."
