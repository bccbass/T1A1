## TCP


TCP forms the basis of how disparate machines on a decentralized internet are be able to communicate. In 1974 a proposal was put forth to link a group of computers together in a decentralized network. As a way to facisilitate this 'inter-network' TCP, or transmission control protocol, was suggested as a way to regulate communication between machines. (1) TCP is a way to send and recieve data securely and reliably over sometimes unreliable and unstable networs. (2) Like UDP, TCP utilizes TCP segments (packets) to break up larger amounts of data and send over various routes. TCP is responsible for creating reliable and stable channels over which network applications can communicate. One prime use case of TCP relating to client/server communication can be found in HTTP: HTTP requires a reliable connection and relies on TCP to ttransfer its request/response pairs.(3) This forms the basic protocol for web browsers to send and recieve information. 
## HTTP and HTTPS
HTTP, or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is an extensible protocol that governs all exchanges of data on the web. (3) It is a client-server process and is always initiated by a client. This is a process that occurs anytime a website is queried; a tcp connection is established, a clients user-agent(typically a web browser) will send a get request for a specific URI or URL (a web address) and after passing through a number of proxies, a server will deliver a response if the form of a status message and if successful will serve the requested resource. (4) HTTPS is HTTP with added security features. It implements Transport Layer Security (previously SSL) to encrypt and verify requests, creating a secure client-server interaction. (5)

## Web Browsers and Developer Tools

Web browsers are applications that have a great deal of functionality, namely making client requests to servers using HTTP and rendering and displaying the server response. After a browser makes a request to a server and successfully recieves a response it is then tasked with rendering the response. There are many elements a browser is tasked with interpreting and rendering: the content and structure provided in HTML documents, styling and layout from a CSS file, interpreting the logic supplied by a JavaScript file or embedded code as well as fetching and utilizing any linked resources including images, videos and pdfs. Browsers will often supply a suite of developer tools that are invaluable when developing web sites and applications. They can display every element of a website including HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as DOM, http status code, network and session information.

 However, TCP utilizes more technologies to ensure secure connections, confirmation of segment reciept  and segment reording when necessary. A three way handshake ensures secure communication, and a header attached to the data payload enables checksum data validation, reordering, confirmation receipt of segmentsm among other functionality.
