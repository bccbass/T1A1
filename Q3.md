### TCP






In 1974 a proposal was put forth to link a group of computers together in a decentralized network.To facilitate this 'inter-network' TCP, or transmission control protocol, was proposed as a way to regulate communication between machines.$^1$  TCP is a way to send and receive data securely and reliably over sometimes unreliable and unstable networks.$^2$  TCP uses TCP segments (or packets) to break up data and transfer over various routes. 
It also implements technologies to ensure secure connections, confirmation of receipt  and segment re-ordering when necessary. A three way handshake ensures secure communication and a header attached to the data payload enables checksum data validation, reordering, confirmation receipt of segments and routing log. TCP is responsible for creating reliable and stable channels over which network applications can communicate, forming the basis for file transfers, email and web browsing. Take for example the familiar act of browsing the web: HTTP, the protocol for requesting and receiving web pages and data, requires a reliable connection and depends on TCP to establish secure connections and to transfer request/response pairs.$^3$  TCP forms the technological bedrock that facilitates the unfathomable amount of client/server data transferred daily. 

### HTTP and HTTPS
HTTP, or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is an extensible protocol that governs all exchanges of data on the web. (3) It is a client-server process and is always initiated by a client. This is a process that occurs anytime a website is queried; a tcp connection is established, a clients user-agent(typically a web browser) will send a get request for a specific URI or URL (a web address) and after passing through a number of proxies a server will deliver a response in the form of a status message and if successful will serve the requested resource. (4) HTTPS is HTTP with added security features. It implements Transport Layer Security (previously SSL) to encrypt and verify requests, creating a secure client-server interaction. HTTPS is crucial for users to safely access servers for banking, e-commerce, transferring sensitive medical as well as general web security and privacy. (5) HTTP requests occur every time a client attempts to access, edit or update a web resource. These take the forms of GET, POST and PATCH requests respectively and occur for every instance a user navigates to a web resource or requests to delete, create or alter a resource. An HTTP request occurs every time a user navigates to a website and its frequency and importance cannot be overstated with regard to client-server interaction. 

### Web Browsers and Developer Tools

Web browsers are applications that have a great deal of functionality, namely making client requests to servers using HTTP and rendering and displaying the server response. After a browser makes a request to a server and successfully receives a response it is then tasked with rendering the response. There are many elements a browser then interprets and renders: the content and structure provided in HTML documents, styling and layout from a CSS file, interpreting the logic supplied by a JavaScript file or embedded code as well as fetching and utilizing any linked resources including images, fonts, icons, videos and pdfs. Browsers will often supply a suite of developer tools that are invaluable when developing web sites and applications. They can display every element of a website including HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as DOM, http status codes, network and session information. The importance of web browsers to modern client-server interactions is almost so gargantuan we take it for granted, like the air we breathe or the clean water that flows from our taps on demand. It provides great convenience, available on pretty almost any modern computing device, and is a far cry from the days of usenet, America Online, BBS and other antiquated means of accessing the internet to communicate with fellow humans from around the globe.
