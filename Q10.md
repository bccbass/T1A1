>Explain data types, using examples

Because a computer cannot differentiate variable types and the ways they can and cannot be stored and used it is important to implemement data types within programming languages.(1) Data types dicatate how a variable can be used, manipulated and how they operate within a language. When a mismatched data type is introduced to a program a type error is thrown, preventing further executing of the code. There are many data types including; integer, string, character, Boolean, void and date.  Different data types will dictate how seemingly similar variables will be acted on with the same operator: 
```
1 + 1 = 2
```
results in the sum of 2 after a mathematical expression as the data type is a number. However, if we wrapped our numbers in quotes making them strings we would have a totally different result:
```
'1' + '1' = '11'`
```
If we have a conditional expression the program must be passed a Boolean value. If the program does not recieve a Boolean input of True or False it will return a type error. After all if we need to know if it is raining an input of 23 will not suffice. 

### A few examples of data types in Python: 


**Numeric types** encompasse three subtypes: **int, float** and **complex**. 1. 

- An int represents an integer: a whole number without a fractional component, either positive or negative.  ```eg. 1, 8, -16, -256```
- A float represents any number, positive or negative, that has a decimal with a fractional component. 
```eg. 1.2, 2.4, 3.14159, -10000.00001```
- Complex numbers represent imaginary numbers comprised of a number and an imaginary part denoted with a j. 2.  

While these three numerical data types are distinct, Python allows for mixed arithmetic between them and will automatically adjust type to match width of the widest eleement within an expression.  

eg. ```1 + 1.5 = 2.5```  will be internally adjusted to ```1.0 + 1.5 = 2.5```.  

Why not just have one numerical data type? Storing unneeded fractional or imaginary information is costly both to memory and processing speed so it is best to only allocate those resources only when necessary.

Numeric types are used strictly to represent values and for implemenation in mathemetical contexts. For a numerical symbol to be used in a string statement it must be converted to a string type first. 3. 


**Strings** are an indexed array of unicode characters contained within either single ``` ` ``` or double ``` " ``` quotation marks. Strings are typically used to represent words, sentences and phrases. They are zero-indexed, have length and their contents can be accessed using bracket notation like any array.: 
``` 
myString = "Hello, world!"
firstLetter = myString[0] 
print(firstLetter) # prints 'H'
 ```
 Strings are essential to programming language as they introduce meaning and human readability to code. They allow us to store, manipulate and make use of the most familiar and universal type of human communication and expression.  

A **Bool** is short for Boolean, named for English mathemetician George Boole. 4.  
A Boolean is used to represent two states: True or False. Bools are essential in Python as they are the basis of control flow structures and conditional logic. They are particularly useful in computer science as their True/False structure is analogous to a computers Binary language: 1 or 0, True or False.  5.
An example of a boolean used in a control flow structures can be seen in the following simple example: 
``` 
#Set isRaining variable to True
isRaining = True
#Checks if it is raining outside to control the flow of the output phrase:  
if isRaining:
# If it is raining print to stay inside
    print("Stay inside or you will get wet")
#Otherwise it prints its safe to go outside and play.
else: print("Go out and play!)  
```
