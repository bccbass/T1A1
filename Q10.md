## Q10

>Explain data types, using examples

Because a computer cannot differentiate variable types and the ways they can and cannot be stored and used it is important to implemement data types within programming languages.(1) This dicatates how a variable is used, manipulated and operates within code. When a mismatched data type is introduced to a program a type error is thrown, preventing further executing of the code. Some examples of data types include; integers, strings, characters, Booleans and void.  Different data types will dictate how seemingly similar variables will be acted on with the same operator: 
```
1 + 1 = 2
```
results in the sum of 2 after a mathematical expression as the data type is a number. If we had our numbers wrapped in quotes making them string typse we would have a totally different result:
```
'1' + '1' = '11'`
```
If we have a conditional expression the program must be passed a Boolean value. Anything other than True or False, string, void or float, will not suffice. If the program does not recieve a Boolean input it will return a type error.
