>Explain control flow, using examples from the Python programming language  


Control flow is the order in which a computer program executes its code. Without any conditional logic, programming languages such as Python and JavaScript execute sequentially, line by line from top to bottom. This is acceptable when there is no need for conditional logic or dynamically changing variables: 
```
def areaOfRectangle(length, width):
2       return length * width
3   
4   print(areaOfRectangle(12, 16))
#prints 192
```
In this example we define the function areaOfRectangle first, we then invoke the function with hard coded values of 12 and 16. The code is executed sequentially and prints our result of 192.

In order to create dynamically controlled flow within a program we can implement conditional logic. The backbone of conditional logic is the ternary operator, or Boolean. A boolean is either ```True``` or ```False```, and combined with ```else```, ```elif``` (else if), and ```else``` statements help to create more complex and flexible programs. With these structures we are able to control under which conditions certain blocks of code will be executed, and when. With conditional logic introduced into our control flow the program ceases to have to execute sequentially:
```
def weatherSummary(isRaining):
    if isRaining:
        print("It's wet outside")
    else:
        print("Let's get out of the house!")

```
In this previous code example we are able to account for two different dynamic conditions: is it raining or not? For each unique condition we are able to control which blocks of code will be executed and pass over the code that does not pertain to our particular scenario.  

We are able to combine and alter different conditional scenarios with Boolean Operators ```and```, ```or```, and ```not```. The ```and``` and ```or``` operators are used to string together multiple conditional statements. 
```
if isRaining and isCold:
    print('Stay inside, it is miserable out there')

if isSunny or houseOnFire:
    print('I think we should get outside.')
```
The ```and``` operator requires both conditionals evaluate to true, while the ```or``` operator requires just one condition (or more) to evaluate to true.

The ```not``` operator negates any proceeding statement:
```
1   isRaining = False
2   
3   if not isRaining:
4       print('I will not need an umbrella today!')

```
This double negative of 'not false' results in a True evaluation to let us know it will not be raining in the near future.

Understanding and controlling the flow of a program is essential to creating useful and powerful code able to conform to various dynamic conditions. It also creates more efficient code that can ignore unneeded or superfluous blocks of code for a given scenario.
