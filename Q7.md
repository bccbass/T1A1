### _Twitter, Free Speech and the Media_
- Not interested in politics but of priniciple, ethics and legality.
- What ethical responsiblity is there for censoring media stories 
- Should it be curated or free speech absolutism
- Is there one correct ethical stance
- legal case of documentary, trump 

Twitters selective censoring of certain media outlets and stories is an interesting case study: the same company has been run by both left-coded Jack Dorsey and right-coded Elon Musk. Yet Twitter has removed stories and limited reach of media outlets from opposing political sides under both leaders. This is evidenced in Twitter-under-Dorsey working closely with US government administration to ban targeted media topics and under Musks leadership as seen in the labeling of NPR as government affiliated media and the moderation and censoring of a Canadian documentary critical of unchecked corporate power (The New Corporation, 2021). As an American the importance of the first Ammendment is ingrained from a very early age and is rooted in a principled free speech absolutism, however the law is very clear that Twitter, under both leaders, as a private company in no way ran afoul of the first ammendment and can moderate its platform as it sees fit. But how does the IT professional square these policies with respect to to their own personal ethical code? The removal of harmful or targeted disinformation seems like a good idea (this would have been a godsend with regard to Facebooks role in the Rohingya Muslim genocide in Myanmar), but this question of free speech absolutism is more likely a personal value-set as the law provides no legal recourse if a Twitter employee sees moderation or censoring of media that they may disagree with. As a single employee of a bohemoth corporation bound to iron-clad NDA's I would posit that the only recourse and responsiblity a developer at Twitter might have in the scenario of free speech, freedom of thought and the media, is to ensure their work and their employers values are in harmony with their personal values, and if not, start applying for roles that align more closely them. As Civil Rights law firm Chandra Law states when asked if one can sue social media sites over first ammendment issues: “The answer is always ‘no.’ Not if you expect to get anything out of it, anyway…. Please do not contact us about this.” $^1$

### _NSO Pegasus Spyware_

>"The most serious implications of something like Pegasus is that it makes it much more unlikely that a dictatorial regime will become a democracy because those were already regimes and systems that were obsessive about trying to monitor their populations so that they could control them and prevent them from rising up and overthrowing them. And this technology exponentially increases your capacity to do that."

NSO groups spyware technology Pegasus is marketed as a means to fight gun violence, crime and terrorism, however its defacto application seems to be far less noble. When successfully embedded on a targets mobile phone Pegasus has root administrator access to the entire device including GPS, voice, photo and data. The Forbidden Stories media collective uncovered widespread governmental abuse of the software in a widely publisized report released in 2021. Pegasus is a technology created by Israeli tech company NSO and is sold to other nation-states only after Israeli government approval for the contract. While this is ostensibly for anti-crime and anti-terror applications the report uncovered Pegasus Software engaged by 45 nations targeting a minimum of 1400 journalists, aid workers and government officials. Perhaps the most high profile occurance was its role in the assasination of dissident Jamaal Khashoggi, a Washington Post reporter living in the US who was critical of the Saudi government. The software was allegedly placed on the phones of members of his inner circle by Saudi security officials months before he was assasinted and dismemebered at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. While NSO denies any wrong doing WhatsApp parent company Meta and Apple have began lawsuits, with the Meta suit just receiving a US Supreme Court ruling that it may proceed. The biden administration has blacklisted NSO and included it in an "entities list" of organizations that are “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Although this is a tool implemented by the highest structures of power it is important to remember that it was developed and created by IT professionals, begging the question as to what their ethical responsibility is in contributing to a software that can be used so harmfully. It seems that while there may have been no domestic laws broken, because the tech is deployed globally is falls under a broader swath of regulation, and quite clearly has run afoul legally. In my opinion an IT professional should feel obligation to uphold a rigorous set of personal ethics and blow a whistle when their professional responsibilities cross clear cut legal and ethical boundaries. In the case of Pegasus there is clear legal precedent for a developer to raise an alarm and alert management, media or outside entities of the abuses taking place. Regardless of whether or not the techs intent was benevelent it was clear that it was being used to monitor and supress political dissent by authoritarian nation states. As the previous, tangentially related yet comparatively frivolous, Twitter example showed it is nigh impossible for a single developer to change the course of their outsized and outresourced employer. Although it is comforting to think that as individuals we have the power to affect change in a meaningful way and will be lauded positively and proportionally to the moral courage exhibited I am reminded of the case of American whistleblower Edward Snowden, an IT professional who observed an illegal abuse in the professional role he was occupying. After exhausting legal internal avenues to raise the alarm and alert management of ethical breaches he resorted to blowing the whistle and turning to the media and we all know what rewards he received for his ethical rigor. Without seeming pessimistic (which I don't believe I am), we are all individuals working within potentially larger power super structures. I can not imagine a scenario where a developer at Pegasus would be able to alter the policies of NSO via proscribed channels or outside whistleblowing in an effective way that would not create life-changing repurcussions for themselves. And while unlike in the Twitter example there are clearly international laws violated with NSO's Pegasus software I fear the developers options for remediation are quite similar to that of the Twitter developers: resign from your role creating unethical technology and fine a role that alligns with your values. As mere individuals this is about the extent of our ethical power in relation to the stuper structures of State and Billion Dollar Corporations. While researching these topics and thinking about a developers potential recourse one line from from Haile Selassie I's 1963 address to the United Nations kept replaying in my mind: "And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls." This is where the answers to our ethical responsibilities lie professionally and more encompassingly as human beings.




sellasie: And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls. We must become something we have never been and for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us. We must become bigger than we have been : more courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook.


“When an iPhone is compromised, it’s done in such a way that allows the attacker to obtain so-called root privileges, or administrative privileges, on the device,” said Guarnieri. “Pegasus can do more than what the owner of the device can do.”

“This is a question that gets asked to me pretty much every time we do forensics with somebody: ‘What can I do to stop this happening again?’” said Guarnieri. “The real honest answer is nothing.”

nso dispute in response to Amnesty Internationals technical report:
Such services are openly available to anyone, anywhere, and anytime, and are commonly used by governmental agencies for numerous purposes, as well as by private companies worldwide. It is also beyond dispute that the data has many legitimate and entirely proper uses having nothing to do with surveillance or with NSO, so there can be no factual basis to suggest that a use of the data somehow equates to surveillance.

The Biden administration blacklisted NSO Group from receiving access to certain U.S. technologies last month, adding it to an “entities list” reserved for companies whose activities are “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” NSO said it was “dismayed” by the move and is seeking its reversal.

NSO was recently placed on a blacklist by the US Department of Commerce, preventing US companies from providing NSO with goods or services. 


“Fortunately, most journalists haven’t historically had to worry about attacks or surveillance from state-level adversaries,” said Parker Higgins, director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. “Organizations like the NSO Group threaten to bring that level of danger to a much broader swath of reporters and sources.”
