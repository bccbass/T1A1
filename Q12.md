##Q12

The code snippet below will not run because the ```input()``` function automatically stores user input as a string. To test this we can invoke the ```type()``` function with ```celsius``` as an argument and it will confirm that it is a string. Because Python does not type coerce from string to float/int we will need to employ type conversion to convert our celsius variable to either an integer or a float in order for the function work as expected.

*one possible solution:*
```
celsius = float(input())

farehnheit = (celsius*9/5)+32

print(f"The result is: {farehnheit}.")
```
